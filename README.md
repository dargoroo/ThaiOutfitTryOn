## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.8+
* pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/dargoroo/ThaiOutfitTryOn.git](https://github.com/dargoroo/ThaiOutfitTryOn.git)
    cd ThaiOutfitTryOn
    ```

2.  **Install required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy tk
    ```
    *(Note: `tk` is usually bundled with Python. If you face issues, you might need to install `python3-tk` on Linux or ensure Tkinter is included in your Python installation on Windows/macOS.)*

3.  **Prepare Assets:**
    * Ensure you have a folder named `Thai_outfit` in the root directory of the project, containing your `.png` outfit images (e.g., `thai_outfit_1_1.png`, `thai_outfit_2_1.png`).
    * Ensure you have a folder named `img` in the root directory, containing your `.png` cartoon character images (e.g., `image_0_0.png`, `image_1_0.png`).

### Running the Application

Execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
